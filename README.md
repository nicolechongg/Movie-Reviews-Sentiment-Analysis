# Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on movie reviews sentiment analysis. This project aims to classify the sentiment of movie reviews as positive, negative or neutral based on text analysis using natural language processing techniques.

## Repository Structure

## Project Description

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on movie reviews using machine learning models. We explored various natural language processing techniques such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification using models like logistic regression, random forests as well as deep learning models like CNN.

Key steps in the project include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

The full code and detailed explanations are available in the Jupyter notebook (`group49_report+notebook.ipynb`).
